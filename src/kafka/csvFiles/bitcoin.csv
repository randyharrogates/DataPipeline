Possible microinfluencer scammer asking people on instagram to buy crypto and send to her, promising great returns but with no proof that she's actually getting it.|422|sxta3b|90|1645449334.0|"**TLDR**: Probably fake microinfluencer (7.5k followers) is possibly scamming people by asking them to buy crypto and send to her account. Not sure if she is a mule or not, but I have strong confidence innocent people are getting scammed out of their money. The reason i am confident is that even though she is showing that she is getting money, there is no proof on the blockchain that she has sent any money out. Only received. She has a friend who supposedly first doubled her money. Then turned 450 in 4500. Then deposited 1k. Then deposited 2k to get 20k within 24 hours. However, there is **NO PROOF** of this on the blockchain. The only proof she has is a screenshot which i'm certain is badly cropped and fake. I'll probably get blocked by her soon but till then, I'll post updates. She has already privated her account and I'm thinking she'll delete it soon. I was planning to string her on a while more to get more info about her accounts etc, but the number of people falling for this is saddening so I hope this message goes out to them. Please help spread the news and keep your friends alert. I haven't been scammed yet (since I didn't send any bitcoin), so I can't lodge a police report. However, if you have friends who have, please DO REPORT IT!  Do we have any recourse against possible scammers? Worst comes to worst, please report the account ( [https://instagram.com/av.drey](https://instagram.com/av.drey?utm_medium=copy_link)) and possible accomplice ( [https://instagram.com/\_xminnx\_](https://instagram.com/_xminnx_?utm_medium=copy_link) ). Stay Safe. &#x200B; **Long Version with Pics and Proof:** So I came across this ""influencer""\* (not very active but has significant  and impressionable following) who may be scamming people. Her following includes some other influencers. I say ""may""  because her tactics are like all the scammers but I haven't given any  money to lose yet, so maybe she's saying the truth. You judge and say. [Instagram profile of av.drey](https://preview.redd.it/nbu7fw9qc6j81.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5f05e28482f3b602ced539cb71deb0c394aca3d3) \*Disclaimer: I'm not convinced she's a real person. The last post was  2020 and only thing she has posted recently is this possible scam. Then again, gen z be like that. She posted stories saying guaranteed bitcoin and showing ""proof"" that  she's withdrawing 1000+ everyday with no effort. Most people would sense something is wrong and leave but i wanted to see whether it was a scam.  [Screesnshot of her stories \(inclduing \_xminnx\_ Testimonial\) \*Had to combine 2 to fit reddit's limit.](https://preview.redd.it/d0t617hjr6j81.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=30abcd3b458b07e72517610969f1c8eadc39e71a) She also had a ""testimonial"" from someone. I dont know who this person is but looks legit. A bit sus though as will see later. This Testimonial friend - Minyi - is going to be important later.  Anyway, moving on... [i messaged her and she asked me to download the bitcoin .com app and register \(I have the screenshot but due to reddit's limit couldnt post the text where she asks me to register\).](https://preview.redd.it/g6gibcgod6j81.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5838440240d0cc9c685b48c0a7e1761a01d4e9ce) [ Asked me to click \\""Buy\\"" on BTC.  ](https://preview.redd.it/ah313ffme6j81.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a5b2cb15529dc84e0f94f0b9b1e12e9d1c77c773) [ The default buy amount was 300 usd. She said to continue. ](https://preview.redd.it/43gau35re6j81.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=55599c232b5e727ca6ee91e348c276d35c9e189b) Now, when you buy crypto, the amount is sent to a wallet with a unique address. Once you send to a wrong address, you have lost your crypto forever. That's how many scammers work - they ask you to send to them and promise to return more, but then they dont.  [She asked that instead of topping up my own wallet, I top up someone else's one. ](https://preview.redd.it/p0d83dyte6j81.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5139a5f02fa3f9ca17e3fdf5f17a09677365da79) Ironically, this makes it less suspicious because this is a financial crime due to the bank sending the money to the wallet rather than having it be sent through another crypto account. And people wouldn't be dumb enough to do that, right? &#x200B; [ Anyway, when she noticed i was buying 30 dollars only, she asked me to  do more.   ](https://preview.redd.it/xlp8a338f6j81.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e1a0c9540c09cc10ab4241b2134f5d051c8686a2) Common scam tactic, because if it was not a scam, why not let me experiment with a bit first and then send more? [ Anyway, her justifications were vague so it didn't assure me at all. But i can see it may have assured other less suspicious people \(authority bias?\)  ](https://preview.redd.it/ddpyvumef6j81.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=91ff858a15e2ddd94e8c7606b3f528d7ebe364ad) [ I explained that i cannot pay now due to bills. ](https://preview.redd.it/d51ixp8if6j81.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e9843802ee9216d0ff88b30a03b7c7bd987fc578) Part of this is actually true. I have dependents whom i have to pay medical bills for. However, i do have more than 30 dollars in my account.   [ She still encourages me to put that remaining money in even if it means cannot pay for kid's medicine. ](https://preview.redd.it/ge2nxjnof6j81.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7eab17edfc6706580eb42a8d07d721cc5ea3f862) Either this is a foolproof method or she is quite heartless. But hey 10x return in a  day! who wouldnt want! Sadly, she ignored my request to lend me money even though she's swimming in it supposedly.   &#x200B; [ So i said I'll get back to her later. ](https://preview.redd.it/rhgcczktf6j81.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=217e4a57221f50a523eddd9cd3cf26446d9f3162) [I confirmed the wallet address was the same one the other \\""testimonial\\"" girl from before used. She said it was.](https://preview.redd.it/0cimqd52g6j81.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=125070a89acea8f66f48d65d60d10b42239cc850) [Also, it appears that she forgot our whole convo and asked if i downloaded the app.](https://preview.redd.it/s1a9kzr5g6j81.jpg?width=540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ece613312ec818dcae07e2399437f884a7ec52d3) Actually, I'm kinda scared when i saw her ask me the app thing again. Because it either means its 1 person scamming so many people cannot keep track. Or multiple people scamming using 1 account. Both suck. She gave me her wallet address. One of the great things about btc or crypto is that you can actually see the transactions in and out of a wallet. You can use a website like blockchain .com.  Link to her account:  [https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/bc1qculp6qgk3h92ml2xafugzva5qj6qe4gmjcthyt](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/bc1qculp6qgk3h92ml2xafugzva5qj6qe4gmjcthyt?page=2) &#x200B; [So i entered her  wallet address and as if 3:20 today, there were only 39 transactions.  Put simply, it's not an active trading wallet. ](https://preview.redd.it/4gdsewshg6j81.jpg?width=540&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0a27743efd26d16248a5cd36fa0cc4ed7facba76) [ Update: as of 5 pm, there were 44 transactions, which means 5 more  people went through the process i described and gave money to the  wallet. ](https://preview.redd.it/1if27yjog6j81.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b70c699feaf61cfd87b69f36ec9ad97e36cc7001) Update, as of posting this, 3 more people were possibly conned. As you can see, the net amount in the wallet is positive, meaning it has received more than it has given out.    So do you remember, this lady who supposedly got 4.5 k and then deposited a further 1k? Which wallet is she dealing with?  No record of 4.5k going out! I think that means she is an accomplice! Anyway, the last time this wallet sent money out was last week. But our micro influencer says she's getting everyday? Which wallet is sending to her?  I'm 99% convinced it's a scam. And more people are falling for it every hour. &#x200B; [She posted this again just a while back.](https://preview.redd.it/7jaycf26h6j81.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a7e2002f85a0929e1e4d5ab7940180f76fbb9f7c) If someone you know may have been potentially scammed by either party ( [https://instagram.com/av.drey](https://instagram.com/av.drey?utm_medium=copy_link) or  [https://instagram.com/\_xminnx\_](https://instagram.com/_xminnx_?utm_medium=copy_link) ), please ask them to report to the police immediately unless of course they can show the transactions on the blockchain. &#x200B; **Update:** Right as I was about to post this, one of the lines I'd cast caught something. Basically, I had messaged the ""testimonial"" friend (Minyi) about whether this was legit. The purpose was to see if they're part of the possible scam together or not. These were her responses that I got just now: [Supposedly she not only got 4.5 k yesterday, she also got 20k few days back. Why she would not put a higher amount if she already got 20k is a mystery.](https://preview.redd.it/vep8qd31o6j81.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=be73d9d773db1ecb4257f5dc9009ec4d618cac70) [Her proof is not a transaction code, but a screenshot. And it is not even a full screenshot, just a cropped one](https://preview.redd.it/hybfm5v8o6j81.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=17b4875904859c20b27a5f4f3c186be88dc82f67) I confirmed if the blockchain address was the same. She said it was. I checked if there were any 2k deposits recently to see if her story checked out. Best I found was Someone deposited 1.1k yesterday, which doesn't support Testimonal friend Minyi's accounts. I suspect they're defrauding people together. (Verify for yourself:    TXN Hash: [https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/daf53b06453f74607023cd108e0efc7177ea7b70c58ae828ebaf575e8bebaf41](https://www.blockchain.com/btc/tx/daf53b06453f74607023cd108e0efc7177ea7b70c58ae828ebaf575e8bebaf41) ) &#x200B; [But I'll give her credit for one thing - as a scammer, I'd have thought she'd encourage me more to invest once I said \\""I think about it\\"".](https://preview.redd.it/l2nec3enp6j81.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4af9071fcddf08ac012fa54c69e960414fba46e8) So that's why I'm 99% sure this is a scam. Or maybe they're just bad scammers. So anyway back to the main person av.drey. I'm quite certain she'll disable her account soon so that everyone forgets about it. She's already privated it.  [This is the person's face that is being used. If some scammer is using her photo without her knowledge, please inform this person so they can take action.](https://preview.redd.it/wbqjtkyqq6j81.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d9a8d56c8c07cb47cb22f805960dbb3c581241aa) &#x200B; &#x200B; &#x200B; **Please help spread the news and keep your friends alert.

To those still looking for jobs and/or are looking for a career transition, I hope my little story on 'how I switched job industries despite retrenchment, getting a more than 50% pay increase' inspires you today, to take the next step in improving your chances of getting hired.|40|n29he4|37|1619837274.0|*TL;DR*: I got retrenched in April 2020, got a temporary job, became aimless and afraid for my future. I decided to take control of my life and picked up an upskilling course in a domain I wasn't sure of, applied for more than 300 jobs and failed, tried a different way of applying and secured a new job with a more than 50% pay increase in an entirely different industry I never expected to be in the first place. &#x200B; **Retrenchment in the height of the Pandemic.** It was April 2020, the height of the COVID-19 Pandemic. Working in the Sports & Events Industry as an Operations Executive slowed down as sales weren’t coming in due to the lockdown. The company could only support me till May 2020 and unfortunately had to let me go by then, making my future uncertain. Fortunately, I had been submitting job applications months before the pandemic hit. I managed to secure a job at a governmental education institution in Singapore, leaving me jobless for only a month as I relied on my emergency savings to tide me through. Going into my new job in June 2020, I was aimless and unsure whether this job would be permanent as I was bound to a **1-year contract** with a slim opportunity for extension. As this job was on a contractual basis, it bred uncertainty and cast doubt onto me as I constantly found ways to prove my capability to my co-workers. &#x200B; >It was extremely stressful to do so as I had to work out of my comfort zone and learn things that I never was interested in to live to see another day. An opportunity arose in September 2020, and I decided to take the plunge to unknown depths — reaching out for that shining bright light at the end of the tunnel. &#x200B; **The shining ray of light through upskilling** 3 months into my job, I learnt that the Singapore Government was rolling out measures to upgrade and upskill workers impacted negatively by the Pandemic. The upskilling initiative focused on helping workers interested in making career transitions when the COVID-19 situation improved. In my contractual role, I discovered a new interest and passion for Blockchain and Cryptocurrency. This ties in perfectly as the Government has earmarked the Fintech Industry as one of the industries in demand and is growing exponentially. I decided that enough was enough and that I had to take control of my life and, eventually, my future. I figured that I was only 27 years old then, and I’d rather suffer and work hard for the next 3 years now than lamenting on what I should have done when I am in my late 40s. I eventually signed up for a full-time course designed to give me a 9-month crash course in Fintech, thereby imparting highly technical skills like web development, programming and even project management experience. Going into the course, I didn’t know what to expect or what I could achieve — but it was a step into the darkness I was willing to take. &#x200B; **It takes only ONE** Working and studying full-time was not an easy task. I had to learn how to multitask during the workweek while also listening to the important pointers raised when lessons were ongoing. Ever had a meeting with your managers while your lecturers are speaking? Been there, done that. I am extremely thankful that I was working from home then, and the mode of delivery for the course was fully online — which allowed me to juggle between both commitments to the best of my ability. As the course was scheduled to run from September 2020 to June 2021, I didn’t give up hope and continued to apply for jobs in the hopes of moving on to a role that would fully utilize my skillsets and experience. However, it was all for nought. More than 300 job applications, several interviews led to final interviews, which also led to nothing as I was ghosted, ignored and left wondering what was wrong. One day in February 2021, I woke up with an epiphany and found out what I was doing wrong all this time. I read articles from **The Woke Salary Man**, like finding out why I was underpaid and pinpointed the problem.  My mistake? I **‘sprayed’** my job applications to hundreds of employers with a generic resume and the usual ‘Dear Sir/Mdm’ emails and **‘prayed’** for the best possible result.  &#x200B; >It was like the lottery. When the hiring manager called me back for an interview, I shouted for joy — but that was it, no job offers, nothing at all. &#x200B; I decided to try something different. It would take some patience and time to do so — and I had both (my contractual role ends in June 2021). Firstly, I had to build my portfolio to make sure I was credible and had works to show my potential employers the knowledge and experience I had. I decided to start writing articles on my personal experiences and interests in Cryptocurrency. That is why you see this post right now because it was one of the factors that contributed to a job offer 😊.  Secondly, I conducted extensive research on the major players in Cryptocurrency and found out who their hiring managers were. I wrote personalized cover letters to them, and the cover letters elaborated my personal vestments, knowledge and experience with Cryptocurrency and Blockchain. Still, think cover letters are not important? A cover letter was what proved me to several potential companies I applied for — like Paxos and, eventually, my current employers. Lastly, all it takes is patience, determination, grit and commitment to your cause (and a little bit of luck). I could have easily told myself after 2 weeks to stop writing articles because I wasn’t receiving any responses from the jobs I applied for. Still, I soldiered on and wrote different articles relating to Cryptocurrency. A month later, my wife sent me a job advertisement on a Job Ads Group in Telegram advertising that Hodlnaut is looking to hire for a **Social Media Manager.** I already knew of the company because I wanted to use one of the services they provided, earning interest on your Bitcoin, Ethereum or Stablecoin deposits. I jumped at the opportunity, edited my resume and cover letter to suit the job description and also included a link to my ePortfolio and Medium pagewith high confidence that I would receive a response because this time around, I wasn’t a ‘sprayer’ (or a machine gunner in this case), I was a Sniper with a ‘one hit, one kill’ mentality. &#x200B; **Final words** I hope this little story has inspired you to take the next step forward, even if it is into the darkness, to explore and eventually score a better future for yourself.|2021|5|1|09:47:54

Requesting money investment advise|77|h02jxz|113|1591758402.0|Hey guys I am still young around early 20s, got kicked out of my poly Diploma and just got out of prison a few months back. I am going to start getting my private Diploma in a few months. I am currently getting allowance from my parents, $700 for all my expenses. They still support me after what I've done but they are old and are in the low-middle income range. Only one of my parents is working. I tried telling them I can use the income from my side hustle so they don't have to give me allowance but they prefer me to save. I got into prison due to money problems so I can understand why they prefer giving me allowance so I won't go back to my old ways. My plan is to find a part time job while studying, since my school are 4 days a week/3 hours a day, so I don't need to take allowance from them at all and repay them for how much they spend on my lawyer fees and not giving up on me. I am running my a side hustle which gets me around $1300 a month which I put it all in my savings. I have a total of $6000 saved, excluding my crypto. My goal is to get $10,000 in savings by end of this year. I have $170 in Bitcoins and Ethereumn respectively that I categories as long term investment. Do you guys have any books, website, online lessons to recommend me to read and learn about investment? How about any tips or suggestions on how to invest?  Thanks guys! Stay safe. **TLDR**: Early 20s, starting school soon. Side hustle earnings are $1,300. Have $6,000 in savings. Need suggestions/tips of any books, website, online class to learn more about investment/growing my money and suggestions from you guys on what or how to invest on.|2020|6|10|10:06:42

Looking to invest in bitcoins, anyone with experience?|17|40wle9|34|1452756224.0|I have researched quite a bit into purchasing bitcoins and the various exchanges in Singapore. I believe bitcoin holds enormous potential as a decentralized digital asset, can revolutionize micro payments, forex trading and cross border trade, and can hold its own as a reserve currency (SDR's are insufficient and the Rmb still needs major reforms). Based on projected supply, the weakening Chinese currency and increasing acceptance by businesses, I believe that bitcoins will still be massively undervalued even if it recovers to its 2013 peak levels. However, most of fellow Singaporeans I have spoken to have are often unaware about the drawbacks or advantages of bitcoins, despite consistent news coverage worldwide (Barclays announced that it will help charities accept bitcoin payments recently), and I believe MAS actually mentioned that it may tax bitcoin 'barter trade' sometime ago. To Singaporeans actively trading or interested in cryptocurrencies: what future does bitcoins have in Singapore, and what is the investment outlook for bitcoins in the near future? Thank you!|2016|1|14|14:23:44

Recieved a blackmail email from a scammer with my password (it's accurate). What should I do? What to do next?|102|g2uoqw|90|1587096532.0|I recieved the following email from somebody called Corona Lamir: I know your password is [accurate password]. I need your total attention for the upcoming 24 hours, or I will certainly make sure you that you live out of shame for the rest of your life.  Hi, you don't know me personally. But I know just about everything regarding you. Your facebook contact list, phone contacts as well as all the digital activity in your computer from previous 118 days.  Which includes, your self pleasure video clips, which brings me to the primary motive why I am composing this email to you.  Well the previous time you visited the porno web sites, my spyware was activated in your personal computer which ended up shooting a lovely video footage of your masturbation play by triggering your cam.  (you got a really weird taste btw lol)  I own the entire recording. If perhaps you think I 'm fooling around, simply reply proof and I will be forwarding the recording randomly to 6 people you know.  It could be your friend, co workers, boss, parents (I'm not sure! My system will randomly choose the contacts).  Will you be capable to gaze into anyone's eyes again after it? I question that...  Nonetheless, doesn't necessarily have to be that path.  I want to make you a one time, no negotiable offer.  Purchase $ 2000 in bitcoin and send them to the listed below address:  b***c1qk9309jc8z72607u5j67jratxkpwe0xcjjg25pz  [case-SENSITIVE so copy and paste it, and remove *** from it]  (If you don't understand how, lookup how to purchase bitcoin. Do not waste my valuable time)  If you send this 'donation' (we will call this that?). After that, I will vanish and never make contact with you again. I will erase everything I have about you. You may keep on living your regular day to day lifestyle with absolutely no fear.  You have got 24 hours to do so. Your time will start as soon you read this e-mail. I have got an special code that will notify me once you go through this mail therefore don't try to play smart. What should I do? My main concern is having the password leaked - I am not so worried about having my supposed nudes sent to my contacts.  Would like advice please. I also don't want to tell my parents because they will overreact and make things even worse. EDIT: I called the police to about it. They said can make police report and to change your passwords. Will change passwords immediately and consider whether to make the report after work. EDIT 2: Thanks for the useful information guys! Won't make the report as I can't be bothered to go all the way down after work and wait for all the paperwork etc to be done.|2020|4|17|11:08:52

Depressed about future prospects|234|868w56|167|1521692994.0|"Long story short, my dad suffered a major stroke 2 years ago which left him bedridden in a nursing home and I rage quit my job 1 year ago. My father lost all his asset gambling in his younger days so he had no asset to his name and I have been living with his two sisters (unmarried, my aunts). Normally I should not have to worried about this, but it turns out my Dad only had $2 in his bank account after gambling the CPF he withdrew at our world class casino. He didn't have much insurance because he cancelled them to save on premiums. For what he had, Aviva denied his claim because they claim he false declared his health status on application (many years ago) and will thus ""eat"" his premium and terminate the policy. The only thing I managed to claim successfully was the DPS and Eldershield thanks to NTUC, but it was after a lengthy one year process to obtain all the ""funny"" documents they needed. Apparently taking care of a mentally incapacitated person is harder than taking care of a dead person, thanks to red tapes everywhere. You don't just walk and say, I am the son and expect everything to fall into place. There is no one unified system at all. Nonetheless, there was a whole lot of drama in the first year of his stroke due to the hospital, social workers and incapable relatives that requires me to attend to every single thing like I own the company, and I can take time off anytime I want to be a good son like on television. Eventually I was so burn out that everything finally forced me to rage quit my job after a falling out with management. Stuck in a contract was horrible enough but they were so eager to take advantage of the fact that I needed the job and money, instead of negotiating properly. I also dropped out of private uni because I needed cash flow to pay for all of my father's bills and that Kaplan was insensitive to my predicament by not allowing partial refund of my paid fees. Instead asking me to pay the full amount again when I am ready to re-module. I didn't take that well, so I did not extend the deferment. *Let's not say I did not try to get my degree, ok?* My dad rather gamble than fund my studies and when I finally saved enough for further studies, I need to pay for his medical needs. I was screwed over hard, and ultimately no money means no paper degree no matter how talented I may be. I even tried to negotiate with the company to send me for training on company time, but its always no training budget for contract staffs. And then the usual, if you go training on company time, then what we hire you for? During my years in the company, never once was I send for training. When there is a new project, they just hire someone to implement it instead of giving me the opportunity. And when its implemented, I get a few power point slides and magically I'm qualified to support the new system. It really is vomit blood. Although I was jobless for a year, the nice thing was that I was able to get everything settled personally like the good son I should be. Or at least, I thought it should be. But it turns out that putting him in a nursing home does not entirely resolve me of my problem. He has so many medical appointments that requires me to follow up, and if I don't attend, there are funny cases where medication is missing or not collected from the hospital. Or the appointment rescheduled to another time so I can attend. I don't really know whose fault this is since the excuse I keep hearing is that **""Sorry, I don't speak English so I cannot understand""**, so I need to be the one to take care of everything, because once again... I am the son. This keeps taking up my time and I cannot rid myself of them, so this becomes a problem when I want to find a new job. My education level is only up to Diploma and that limits my options. The roles I quality for are pretty much IT Helpdesk / Technicians which don't really have a work life balance option due to over-outsourcing. Pay wise, they are only around $2.6k and it is pretty much a dead end career, so there is no progression path. Having to pay for my father's needs and eventually his 2 sisters as they get older, with this salary really puts me at a lost.  I have a D7 in O'lv math and that is what really screw me over big time but unless I am really that bad at math, I absolutely do not see how I can start a family (If I even have that option) and take care of everyone with a low salary. The reason I need to take care of his 2 sisters is that they took care of me when my father didn't and they took out their savings to pay off my father's gambling debts, which he didn't even brother returning to them when he withdrew his CPF. Even now, when I am not working, for some strange reasons the government's means testing suggest that I can afford to pay $1200++ a month for my father's nursing home and this is excluding all his other medicines and specialist appointments. He has over 20+ medications and among them are anti depressive pills which I don't even have the luxury of taking. As much as I can, I have tried to make ends mean but at some point in time... there is only so much one can do. Social workers I spoke to are like, well live for yourself, not for others. Find a girlfriend! But i look at my situation and I don't exactly see how I even have the luxury to live for myself. If anything, I don't know of any girl in Singapore that would even consider my position as potential boyfriend material. The truth is, I have been fighting by myself for the last 30 years without anyone to seek advise from. Friends? Let's just say, its different from television. Everyone has their own problem and their broken fingernail is more important. The best you can get out of anyone is pretty much, a listening ear on whatsapp and some **""You can do it! You should come to church and donate for Jesus's blessing.""**  I don't blame anyone though and this really issn't a rant post. I appreciate everyone that has been in my life, whether good or bad *(everything is a learning experience)* but ultimately, there is only so much you can beat out of a dead horse. After considering all possible options, I truly believe that ending my life and letting the government take care of my family's needs might be the best logical choice. Alternatively, I can rob the bank and get myself caught intentionally so I can get some free re-skilling opportunities in jail. Maybe when I come out, I can become some story teller with a very dramatic bestseller book to fund my retirement. To be honest, I don't know what I am expecting from this post, but this is in a way my attempt at screaming for help. Whether I deserve help or how much help I truly deserve, I don't know. Counselors always tell stories where family of 4 struggle with a household income of $2k, and they live a very happy, satisfied life so I will be just fine if I try. But how true is this story really? The bright side is that maybe the hubby can have sex with his wife to destress, but I can't fuck anyone in my family to destress. Maybe the 2 kids will grow up and help to support the family, but my situation aren't even that. I honestly feel that, I have reached the end of the crossroad and this is the end of my bloodline. I don't do drugs, I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't go pub/club, I haven never even gone on overseas vacation, never took a plane before, I save whatever I can. I don't even go to cinemas. I'm not even fat, I eat a very cheap diet that puts me a little underweight but where did this effort ultimately took me? A boring person with an unattractive lifestyle that no Singaporean girls will want to date, and a aging family to take care of. Honestly, where is my future? I don't see any. To be honest, I may not have the budget to spurge on dates even if a girl want me. Singapore is just very plain straight forward. **""Bo money ah? Die lor. I only got one life, you want? Come take it la.""** Its a pretty long post, much longer than I expected and I thank you if you have read everything. In a way, I felt better after getting this out. If you are responding though, I have a question. If you were in my position, what would you have done? Would suicide really not be the most educated option? **PS: Pls don't suggest investing in cryptocurrencies. I deleted my bitcoin and doge wallet in 2010.** **Big Edit:** So there are alot of comments way more than I expected and I appreciate all support. I'm not really that responsible a person like some of you think. It is just that, I try to be a good samaritan and so I pick up the slack here and there, and somehow eventually things became so dependent on me that whose else is going to do it, if not me? I'm forced into where I am today not because I want to. I have actually very much considered disavowing my father and then migrating and abandoning everyone for the greater good. If Singapore was bigger, I would most certainly not hesitate to move to another city. Its just that my whole plan was pretty much, once I settled everything. I would kill myself so in a way that was the master plan. I rage quit my job because I knew I didn't need to put up with shit anymore if I am going to die soon. But things wouldn't settle, and it dragged so long to the point where one day I suddenly feel so lonely that I say, maybe I need to do something, walk out of this darkness and attempt to go back to society. But then I have no real plan for it, or maybe I have but I dunno if its a good plan, a bad plan or another disastrous mistake just waiting to happen. There's alot of suggestions in here and I thank you very much. Its true that if I don't suicide, there can be many options out and some of these options involves ignoring the future ahead and then praying that things will work out eventually. That once I get a job, everything will be better. But the real problem here is, and what I can't solve in my head is which I will elaborate further is that instead of saving money every month, all the money goes into my Dad's nursing home and medical bills. Now my aunts don't make much, so its hard for them to chip in much when they also have their own medical issues. So the bulk falls on me but still we get by. Just that nobody saves any money at the end of each month, and pray that the existing savings don't get touched. Why? Because my aunt will need those money themselves when they grow older and retire. So this puts things in a very weird cycle, especially given how I have achieved nothing in life thus far. So I pay, we pay until my Dad dies and he dies a happy man, well cared for and everyone think I am such a good son. Then my aunts turn come and oh because I was so capable of handling things before, people's expectation would be that ""oh, i'm sure he can do it again"". So yup, let's do it again. Then eventually everyone dies, leaving me alone without any savings, career or well... let's not say family. I don't want to make this into a sobbing story of ""I cannot find a girlfriend because I have no money!!"". So well, what do I do? I assume I would be in my late 60s or early 70s by then and I don't expect my health to be 100% perfect so... I die to join everyone in the afterlife. I feel very sad when I think it that way, but I need not be that sad because things haven't played out yet. That's what many are telling me. But I dunno how to ignore something that will eventually happen anyway. Thus, it is just a simple matter of whether I die now in my 30s or i die later in my 70s. Either way, I die as a failure. But its not ""right"" to tell say **""Yes Gram, pls go and kill yourself. I fully support your decision.""** so they say, don't worry. Things will work out. But how will things work out? I ask them, they dunno. I ask myself, I dunno. So... what then? It seems like just delaying the inevitable to me. If I disavow everyone, np. I just restart my life plain and simple, reach 35 buy my own house and throw a house warming party, impregnate my neighbour's daughter by mistake and I start my own family chapter. And I die in my 70s as a successful husband, good father and someone to be ""proud"" of. But do I need to start my own family? Not really. Do I need a girlfriend? Not really. Do I need sex? Not really. They are all luxury, not a necessity. So I choose to sacrifice myself, but then I feel suicidal and ya the cycle begins again. I'm not a dumb person and by no means have I not considered the possibilities. But what I have considered may not be big enough, since there are options that I am unaware of or misunderstood and that it aren't as bad as I painted it. Ok, I am open to explore it but if the advise is just ""Get a job Gram, that's your first step and then start saving!"". That is a pointless advice imo, no matter how reasonable it is because it just puts me back to square one. I am not trying to sound unappreciative btw, I am just frustrated at being looked upon like an idiot. **Edit 2:** Based on the comments, I realized that from my friends' perspective, I am the dead weight so that might be why they aren't ""helping"", just act like things will resolve by itself. Well, I can afford to disavow these friends. Thanks for helping me to realize this! **Edit 3:** Going through all the suggestions and private messages, I am suddenly feeling very overwhelmed by what needs to be done and what I should be doing. My head hurts really bad and I am starting to regret asking for help when I am not ready to be helped. It is all reminding me what I should have or should not done for a better life, and why I wanted to commit suicide in the first place. Now I remember why I concluded it was easier to simply restart a new life and make sure I do it correctly the next time. Sorry guys, I don't think I can do it anymore. I think things just got worse after asking for help."|2018|3|22|11:29:54

Observations by Singaporean(s) at Oxford|234|8aoby6|34|1523169497.0|"#Oxfess16614 The Ultimate Encyclopaedia of Singaporean Students at Oxford 1. The Triple Threat: Chinese, Christian, Government Scholarship holder. Ultra-anglicized scions of the colonial bureaucracy. Grew up in Bukit Timah with multiple generations of family members having attended mission schools before heading to the Raffles or Anglo-Chinese School finishing schools. Knows more Latin than local dialect. Highly familiar with western classical music and literature. Quickly learns upon arrival that you don’t make friends with contemporary Brits by dropping Jane Eyre references and quickly masters Zadie Smith and trap. Learns to distinguish the right kind of woke (environmental charities and effective altruism) from the wrong kind (Rhodes Must Fall) and shuts up about the latter while running to be the face of diversity initiatives. Typically the only students of Asian ethnicity involved in incredibly white shit like choir (not rowing, because these types are either very skinny or quite fat). Graduates from Oxford with a solid First, and returns to rise quickly in a government that gives them extraordinary latitude to impose their versions of Plato’s Republic on the socially-housed denizens of Singapore. No qualms because deep down inside, they know they are born to rule. 2. The Trapped Intellectual: ultra-brainy middle-class kid who couldn’t have afforded Oxford if not for a civil-service scholarship. Really should have studied locally and then gone straight for a PhD. Probably the most brilliant student in JC and definitely took Knowledge and Inquiry (KI) as an A level subject. Realises upon arrival at Oxford that it is hardly an intellectual nirvana at the undergraduate level and starts to regret the decision. A true, dyed in wool liberal, a soul fitted for the life of the mind but forced into government. Frustrated intellectual ambitions will be coped with by writing copious amounts of poetry - some of which will turn out to be quite good - while a middling civil servant, thus fulfilling to a tee the archetype of the Tang Dynasty Bureaucrat-Poet. 3. The Scientist: Schooled all the way through in Hwa Chong, RVHS, Dunman. Almost always middle class, but once in a blue moon you get someone descended from a rubber/tin/finance/real estate billionaire clan. Partially conversant in the Confucian Classics and semi-competitive in games like Chess and Go. Can always be relied on last minute to play Dota but still hands in problem sets on time. Unfailingly turns up CNY event for cheap and good food. Probably bought few thousand dollars worth of Bitcoin in 2015. Will go on to do a PhD in the sciences, and have lots well-remunerated and intellectually fulfilling career options. Aside from the occasional sexist remark about women in STEM, there's really not much else you can hold against them. Attributes their high-functioning, well-adjusted nature to the strong cultivating aspects of their classic education, grounded in 5,000 years of Chinese Wisdom which they, as true heirs to the Chinese Civilisation, helped safeguard from Evil Communists. 4. ​The Hipster Undergrad: Usually female. Excited to come to do History, Literature or Geography, but shit goes downhill after not getting into anything for Spring Week. Takes good photos in Eastern Europe though. If finds a rich white person to marry during undergrad, will go on to work in a media job in London. If that fails, heads to America on Daddy’s coin to do a masters’ degree in another hipster subject, writes sad research paper coining terms like ""Decolonial Aesthesis” to rationalise failed attempts to assimilate into British High Culture. 5. The Careerist: Law, E&M or PPE (without scholarship). Strong minority. Came here because they knew exactly what they wanted to do - which is that they had no idea what they actually wanted to do aside from getting into the most prestigious internships/universities/jobs possible. Makes CNY and Formal Dinners tedious once critical mass of them exceeds a certain proportion. 6. The Philosopher King: Related by blood to Lee Kuan Yew, and living embodiment of the triumvirate of Philosophy, Politics and Economics. Becomes Best Speaker In the World while winning the Gibbs Prize easily, and tops the MPhil in Economics while supported by a Clarendon. Gets into Harvard and then pursues research in Mechanism Design, the hardest, truest and purest branch of microeconomic theory. Tries not to be involved in family feuds but has to step in when the Democracy of the Republic is at stake. 7. The Debater: PPEist has always aspired to be 6 but with mixed success due to lack of 166 IQ royal blood. 8. The FOB Postgrad: Spends way too long being initially over-awed by Oxford and taking embarrassing pictures. Glad they finally made it to this hallowed institution of Singaporean elite culture, but a bit insecure that they didn’t do so for undergrad. However, their confidence grows from strength to strength as they start make contributions to the sum of human knowledge and learn how to use the Manual setting on the DSLR. 9. The Aesthete Postgrad: Doing a DPhil in History, Literature or Oriental Studies. Plays multiple instruments, some of them very obscure. Comes to Oxford already skilled in hipstercraft such as film photography, bicycle repair and tea brewing, even though literally no one does this back home. Generally liked by everyone, but quite reclusive. Underestimated how Conservative the humanities and social sciences departments at Oxford are, and sometimes fantasise about having gone to Cambridge or SOAS instead. Marries a native brit to secure residence while pursuing their low-income, dead-end careers. Happiness and overall sense of well-being and life progress in their 20s bought from wilful ignorance of how brutal the academic job markets in their fields actually are. 10. ​The International School Kid: hello ___________________________________________________________________________________________ source is from facebook link, you can access from [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/aznidentity/comments/8ake1h/hilarious_woke_anonymous_post_from_singaporeans/) "|2018|4|8|13:38:17

Tourists in Singapore and can't access our money. Want some crypto and help us out in the process?|44|7u1fyz|16|1517323303.0|Hey all! We've been in Singapore for over a week and now the bank card is mucking up and we can't withdraw anything. I already called the bank and hopefully they can fix the issue asap, but it's a Spanish bank and has been pretty useless in the past. We do have a bunch of crypto and obviously thought about just withdrawing from a Bitcoin ATM, but turns out they all only allow you to buy... Luckily we'll only be here a couple more days and hotel etc is paid for, but we're running pretty low on dollars and would prefer not having only $2 meals for the next couple days... Anyone here interested in some Stellar, Walton, AMB, ETH, or any other crypto? (I can convert to whatever is listed on Binance and send to any address). We don't need much (again, leaving in a couple days), so anything from S$100-300 would be enough. I would suggest meeting at something like Starbucks where we get Wifi and can have something to drink until the transfer confirms. Can also do multiple small transfers if that makes you feel better – I know it sounds slightly sketchy. We're currently close to Bugis, but probably somewhere Downtown is easiest? I do have a metro card with credit on it, so you tell me where to go. Also, I'll be happy to compensate you for your troubles with a better rate than you can get on Binance. I promise I'm a very friendly guy with his wife and we really are the furthest from sketchy you can think of. If someone could help us out that would be fantastic. Thanks! **EDIT: Two guys have contacted me; we should be fine now. Thanks everyone and especially those two guys; you know who you are :)**|2018|1|30|21:41:43

Found an iPad|12|2qjry9|38|1419705577.0|I found an iPad today at Yishun and am looking for the owner of the iPad. The iPad is passcode locked and does not have an internet connection. The SIM card seems terminated as well. Siri needs a connection to be functional.  I tried searching for the owner on Facebook and Google but can't come up with anything either. Would really appreciate it if anyone can help to trace the owner or a 1/338 chance someone on here knows the owner or people in the attached images.  [Here is all the information I can get from the iPad.](http://imgur.com/RD9LteS,EveX0G2#1) Update at 28 Dec 10.45pm: still no reply from David Low. Thinking of bringing the SIM card to Singtel to get them to trace the owner. Update 2 at 29 Dec 10.46am: I've added David Loh on Facebook and he has accepted my friend request. Had to add David because apparently when I sent him a message Facebook directs it into another inbox unless I'm his friend. Update 3 at 30 Dec 11.07am: David sent me the contact of the iPad owner. I've contacted the owner and will be returning it tomorrow. Happy ending. Update 4 and final edit: The iPad has been returned to it's rightful owner on the 31st of December 2014. I found the owner's dad through David Loh who kindly helped me to contact him. The dad was really thankful and insisted to treat me to something so I settled for a drink. The dad was the one who misplaced his son's iPad and decided to surprise his family with the iPad when he went for dinner with them that night.  Well, it pays to be nice (thank you /u/coinhako for the bitcoins and thank you Mr. Ramli for the treat). A little help here and there won't harm anyone and will make Singapore a happier place to live in :).|2014|12|28|01:39:37

sending money to the UK|3|4m7tud|13|1464882855.0|Dose anyone have a recommendation for the cheapest way to send money to the UK?  In the UK paypal is cheep if it is for personal transactions but is seems here that is not an option. I can send money here cheaply form the UK using currencyfair.com. but I cannot seem to find any cheep way of sending money abroad form Singapore which is really odd to me as there are so many foreigners working here I would have though the competition for business would keep the prise low,  it dose seem to do for money changers if I want to get the money in my pocket. but sending it abroad, I cannot find a cheep way.  Am I missing something?  For example I just sent £500 to the which google gives me the mid market rate of exactly 1000 SGD at the moment. But with OCBC it cost me 1073 SGD to send £500. Is that considered a good rate?  That is divided up into  An exchange rate of 2.0484 (which seems really good) And 3 different fees of $5 $20 $24.58 which dose not seem so good. Any tips?|2016|6|2|22:54:15

These are the things I use so far  1) Uber/Grabtaxi - Whenever I need a cab + When I need to know exact cab fare before cabbing it 2) DBS/UOB Card - Where I store all my money. I use this for most of my transactions.
